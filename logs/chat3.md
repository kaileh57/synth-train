Let me search for high-quality Claude-generated datasets on HuggingFace:Now I'll create a comprehensive plan and separate experiment artifacts for an AI agent to implement. Based on my research, I've found the best high-quality synthetic datasets available.

## Best Synthetic Datasets Found:

1. **Cosmopedia** (25B tokens) - Generated by Mixtral-8x7B, largest open synthetic dataset
2. **FineWeb-Edu** (1.3T tokens) - Filtered by Llama3-70B scoring (educational content)
3. **OpenHermes-2.5** (1M samples) - Primarily GPT-4 generated, very high quality
4. **Magpie Pro** (4M instructions) - Generated from Llama-3-70B using novel technique

Let me create the artifacts:## Summary of Deliverables

I've created a comprehensive research plan with 5 separate artifacts:

### 1. **Master Research Plan** 
- Overview of the entire project
- Selected the best synthetic datasets (OpenHermes-2.5, Magpie-Pro, Cosmopedia, FineWeb-Edu)
- 4-week timeline with clear phases
- $50 budget allocation strategy

### 2. **Experiment 1: Pure Synthetic Excellence**
- Tests if GPT-4 generated data (OpenHermes-2.5) alone can train capable models
- Focuses on 1M high-quality samples
- Complete code structure for data loading, training, and evaluation

### 3. **Experiment 2: Quality vs Quantity Trade-off**
- Implements quality scoring without APIs
- Tests whether 10k ultra-high-quality samples > 100k medium-quality
- Could revolutionize how we think about data requirements

### 4. **Experiment 3: Optimal Dataset Mixing**
- Combines different synthetic datasets for maximum diversity
- Tests 6 different mixture strategies
- Tracks which dataset contributes what to model performance

### 5. **Experiment 4: Zero-Cost Evaluation Framework**
- Complete evaluation system with $0 API costs
- Trains micro-judge models (125M params)
- Combines statistical metrics, proxy tasks, and behavioral tests

## Key Insights from Research:

1. **Best Datasets Found**:
   - **OpenHermes-2.5**: 1M GPT-4 samples (highest quality)
   - **Magpie-Pro**: 500K-4M from Llama-3.1-70B (novel technique)
   - **Cosmopedia**: 25B tokens from Mixtral (largest scale)
   - **FineWeb-Edu**: 1.3T tokens filtered by Llama-70B

2. **Budget Strategy**:
   - 10 GPU-hours total @ $5/hour = $50
   - Use single GPU for development
   - Scale to 8x GPUs only for final runs
   - Each experiment designed to fit budget

3. **Novel Contributions**:
   - First comprehensive <1B model study on pure synthetic data
   - Zero-cost evaluation framework
   - Quality threshold discovery for small models
   - Optimal mixing strategies

Each experiment artifact contains:
- Clear objectives and hypotheses
- Implementation code structure
- Success criteria
- Time/cost estimates
- Expected challenges
- Detailed instructions for an AI agent

The AI agent implementing these should start with Experiment 1 (Pure Synthetic) as it's the simplest and establishes baselines. Then proceed based on results.

Want me to:
- Create more detailed code for any specific component?
- Add additional experiments?
- Refine the evaluation metrics?
- Create a paper outline based on expected results?
