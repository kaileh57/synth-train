I'm excited to collaborate on this research paper! Training LLMs on synthetic data is a hot topic right now, especially with the growing concerns about data quality and availability. Let me search for some recent developments in this area to ensure we're building on the latest work.Now let me search for information about small-scale LLM training experiments that would be feasible with your hardware constraints:Let me search for specific information about small-scale LLM training experiments and projects using synthetic data:Let me search for recent research on synthetic data quality and evaluation methods:Based on my research, I'm excited to help you plan this paper! The timing is perfect - synthetic data for LLM training is a hot topic with lots of room for innovative contributions, especially at the small scale where you can actually run experiments.

Let me create a comprehensive research planning document for you:This plan gives us a solid foundation to start with! A few key insights from my research that will be particularly relevant for your project:

**Hardware Considerations:**
- With 8x RTX 4090s, you'll have 192GB total VRAM, which is plenty for 500M-1B parameter models
- Each 4090 can deliver about 82% performance at 50% power (220W), which could save significant electricity costs during long training runs
- For distributed training, you'll want to use either DataParallel or FSDP (Fully Sharded Data Parallel)

**Recent Breakthroughs to Leverage:**
1. **IBM's LAB method** showed that carefully structured synthetic data with taxonomies can outperform models trained on 15x more data
2. **Conditional prompting** with attribute combinations helps ensure diversity 
3. **Multi-stage generation** (context → query → evolution → filtering) produces higher quality data

**Critical Success Factors:**
- **Data Diversity**: This is the #1 issue with synthetic data - models tend to generate repetitive samples
- **Quality Filtering**: You'll need robust filtering since you can't use GPT-4 as a judge at scale
- **Efficient Training**: With gradient checkpointing and mixed precision, you should be able to fit reasonable batch sizes

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. **Set up a simple proof of concept**: Try training a tiny 125M parameter model first to validate your pipeline
2. **Test data generation**: Create 10K synthetic samples using different methods and manually evaluate quality
3. **Benchmark your hardware**: Run a 24-hour stress test to understand actual throughput

Want me to help you dive deeper into any specific aspect? For example, I could:
- Create detailed code templates for the data generation pipeline
- Design specific synthetic data generation prompts
- Outline the model architecture in detail
- Create evaluation scripts for data quality
