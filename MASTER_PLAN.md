# Synthetic Data LLM Training Research: Master Plan

## Project Overview
This research investigates whether small-scale LLMs (500M-1B parameters) can be effectively trained using only synthetic data, with a focus on practical implementation using consumer-grade hardware (8x RTX 4090s) and a budget constraint of $50.

## Research Questions
1. Can purely synthetic data match or exceed real-data training for small LLMs?
2. What is the quality vs. quantity trade-off for synthetic training data?
3. How should different synthetic datasets be mixed for optimal performance?
4. Can we create a zero-cost evaluation framework that correlates with expensive metrics?
