# Experiment 4: Zero-Cost Evaluation Framework - Instructions

## Overview
Develop and validate a comprehensive evaluation framework for LLMs that requires zero API calls and correlates strongly with expensive metrics like GPT-4 judgments.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup evaluation framework:**
   ```bash
   python evaluator.py  # Test with GPT-2 baseline
   ```

2. **Validate correlations:**
   - Manual annotation of 100 samples
   - Compare with framework predictions
   - Calculate correlation coefficients

3. **Evaluate experimental models:**
   ```bash
   python evaluate_all_experiments.py
   ```

## Expected Results

- Correlation with manual scores: >0.7
- Evaluation speed: <5 minutes per model
- Cost: $0 per evaluation
- Coverage: All major model capabilities

## Success Criteria

1. Framework correlates >0.7 with human judgments
2. Evaluates models 1000x faster than API-based methods
3. Provides interpretable component scores
4. Works completely offline
